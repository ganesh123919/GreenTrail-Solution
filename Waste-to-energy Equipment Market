Global Waste-to-energy Equipment Market Insights
Waste-to-energy Equipment Market size was valued at USD 40 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 69 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2024 to 2030.

Waste-to-energy Equipment Market Overview
The Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Equipment market has been experiencing significant growth, driven by the increasing need for sustainable waste management solutions and renewable energy generation. The market was valued at USD 30.2 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030. This growth is fueled by rising environmental concerns, regulatory pressure to reduce landfills, and the increasing demand for clean energy. WTE technologies, including incineration, gasification, and anaerobic digestion, are being rapidly adopted to meet these demands. As cities and industries generate vast amounts of waste, WTE solutions provide an effective method for reducing waste volume while generating valuable energy, thereby transforming waste into a resource.
